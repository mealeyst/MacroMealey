        <h1>WINDMILLS DO NOT WORK THAT WAY! GOOD NIGHT!</h1>
        <p>Who am I making this out to? Son, as your lawyer, I declare y'all are in a 12-piece bucket o' trouble. But I done struck you a deal: Five hours of community service cleanin' up that ol' mess you caused.</p>
        <p><strong>There, now he's trapped in a book I wrote: a crummy world of plot holes and spelling errors!</strong> <em> You know, I was God once.</em> Our love isn't any different from yours, except it's hotter, because I'm involved.</p>
        <h2>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news!</h2>
        <p>We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Tell her she looks thin. Oh, how awful. Did he at least die painlessly? …To shreds, you say. Well, how is his wife holding up? …To shreds, you say.</p>
        <ol>
        <li>I am Singing Wind, Chief of the Martians.</li><li>Pansy.</li><li>Robot 1-X, save my friends! And Zoidberg!</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>You seem malnourished. Are you suffering from intestinal parasites?</h3>
        <p>Large bet on myself in round one. Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. Yes. You gave me a dollar and some candy. She also liked to shut up! Anyhoo, your net-suits will allow you to experience Fry's worm infested bowels as if you were actually wriggling through them.</p>
        <ul>
        <li>Goodbye, friends. I never thought I'd die like this. But I always really hoped.</li><li>That's not soon enough!</li><li>I barely knew Philip, but as a clergyman I have no problem telling his most intimate friends all about him.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>So I really am important? How I feel when I'm drunk is correct? Okay, I like a challenge. Hey, tell me something. You've got all this money. How come you always dress like you're doing your laundry? I just want to talk. It has nothing to do with mating. Fry, that doesn't make sense.</p>
        <p>Good news, everyone! There's a report on TV with some very bad news! Belligerent and numerous. We need rest. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is spongy and bruised. Who are those horrible orange men?</p>
        <p>For example, if you killed your grandfather, you'd cease to exist! Guards! Bring me the forms I need to fill out to have her taken away! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! Who's brave enough to fly into something we all keep calling a death sphere?</p>
        <p>We're also Santa Claus! Five hours? Aw, man! Couldn't you just get me the death penalty? Doomsday device? Ah, now the ball's in Farnsworth's court! You, a bobsleder!? That I'd like to see! I videotape every customer that comes in here, so that I may blackmail them later.</p>
        <p>File not found. You can see how I lived before I met you. Fetal stemcells, aren't those controversial? Who are those horrible orange men? Look, everyone wants to be like Germany, but do we really have the pure strength of 'will'?</p>
        <p>You can see how I lived before I met you. Kif, I have mated with a woman. Inform the men. I can explain. It's very valuable. You mean while I'm sleeping in it?</p>
        <p>Ok, we'll go deliver this crate like professionals, and then we'll go ride the bumper cars. Soothe us with sweet lies. Tell her she looks thin. Check it out, y'all. Everyone who was invited is here. And why did 'I' have to take a cab?</p>
        <p>I wish! It's a nickel. Fry, we have a crate to deliver. We can't compete with Mom! Her company is big and evil! Ours is small and neutral! I love this planet! I've got wealth, fame, and access to the depths of sleaze that those things bring.</p>
        <p>Then we'll go with that data file! Leela, are you alright? You got wanged on the head. Fry! Stay back! He's too powerful! With a warning label this big, you know they gotta be fun!</p>
        <p>Is today's hectic lifestyle making you tense and impatient? You won't have time for sleeping, soldier, not with all the bed making you'll be doing. Shut up and take my money! File not found. Isn't it true that you have been paid for your testimony?</p>
        <p>Yeah. Give a little credit to our public schools. No! The cat shelter's on to me. Shinier than yours, meatbag. Hi, I'm a naughty nurse, and I really need someone to talk to. $9.95 a minute. This opera's as lousy as it is brilliant! Your lyrics lack subtlety. You can't just have your characters announce how they feel. That makes me feel angry!</p>
