If you have noticed, my last post was back in October, and I said how I had hoped to do quick iterations on my site. Well, that plan backfired as when I showed my site to my peers, I received a deal of feedback, the majority being critical. I decided to start from scratch and re-do the theme of my site from scratch.

So what has changed? The color scheme, the layouts, basically everything! One of the processes that I decided to implement this time was to utilize the Pattern Lab style of organization for my theme. I first tried to utilize the node version of Pattern Lab, but I found that there still seemed to be a few things that were still in flux with the codebase. I looked at other style guide generators and I settled on [Fabricator](https://fbrctr.github.io/).

I am going to be writing up a tutorial on how I integrated Fabricator with Hugo in due time, but needless to say the set up was fairly straight forward. I was extremely impressed with the flexibility that Fabricator offered. I was able to create, iterate, and update my style guide with ease. Some of the longer tasks with the new theme wasn't the coding so much as the creation of icons and interactive form elements in Illustrator. If you want to take a look at the style guide of my site and see how it all comes together, feel free to check it out [here](https://mealeyst.github.io/macromealey/styleguide).

Now that I have a more robust theme created, I am going to be more active. I hope that you enjoy the new theme, feel free to peruse and reach out if you have any questions or comments. I have added some new features to the site as well such as the contact form and the progress tracker in the footer of the site. I will be writing separate tutorials for those features in short order as well, so keep an eye out for that.

All the best!
