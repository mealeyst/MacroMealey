<p>Greetings and salutations!</p>

<p>My name is Shawn Mealey and I am a Engineer currently working for Rockets of Awesome. Based out of New York City, I have had the esteemed privilege to work on many projects with various clients over the course of my five year professional career.  I currently hold a bachelor’s of science degree in information technology from Alfred State College of Technology. I simply love all things technology and I am constantly on the hunt to improve my knowledge and understanding of new languages and processes.</p>

<p>I created this blog as a place to organize my thoughts and to share my work in the hopes of helping fellow programmers. Currently my work involves primarily React work, though I have experience with Node.js, PHP,  and MySQL/PostGres. I am currently working on increasing my skills with Ruby on Rails, Python, and Go. If you ever have any suggestions for technologies that you think that I should check out, I am always open to exploring out new libraries and programming languages (time permitting of course).</p>

<p>In my spare time, I like to exercise, read science fiction, do woodcraft, and get out into nature.  I also spend time with my beautiful fiancée Victoria and our cat Tallulah.</p>
