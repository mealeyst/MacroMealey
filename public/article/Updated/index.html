        <h1>New Look - New Feel</h1>
        <p>If you have noticed, my last post was back in October, and I said how I had hoped to do quick iterations on my site. Well, that plan backfired as when I showed my site to my peers, I received a deal of feedback, the majority being critical. I decided to start from scratch and re-do the theme of my site from scratch.</p>

<p>So what has changed? The color scheme, the layouts, basically everything! One of the processes that I decided to implement this time was to utilize the Pattern Lab style of organization for my theme. I first tried to utilize the node version of Pattern Lab, but I found that there still seemed to be a few things that were still in flux with the codebase. I looked at other style guide generators and I settled on <a href="https://fbrctr.github.io/">Fabricator</a>.</p>

<p>I am going to be writing up a tutorial on how I integrated Fabricator with Hugo in due time, but needless to say the set up was fairly straight forward. I was extremely impressed with the flexibility that Fabricator offered. I was able to create, iterate, and update my style guide with ease. Some of the longer tasks with the new theme wasn&rsquo;t the coding so much as the creation of icons and interactive form elements in Illustrator. If you want to take a look at the style guide of my site and see how it all comes together, feel free to check it out <a href="https://mealeyst.github.io/macromealey/styleguide">here</a>.</p>

<p>Now that I have a more robust theme created, I am going to be more active. I hope that you enjoy the new theme, feel free to peruse and reach out if you have any questions or comments. I have added some new features to the site as well such as the contact form and the progress tracker in the footer of the site. I will be writing separate tutorials for those features in short order as well, so keep an eye out for that.</p>

<p>All the best!</p>
