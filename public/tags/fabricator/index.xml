&lt;p&gt;But little Mouse, you are not alone,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In providing foresight may be vain:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The best laid schemes of mice and men&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go often askew,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And leave us nothing but grief and pain,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For promised joy!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;so-what-happened&#34;&gt;So what happened?&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you have noticed, my last post was back in October, and I said how I had hoped to do quick iterations on my site. Well, that plan backfired when I showed my site to my peers, I received a deal of feedback, the majority being critical. I decided to start from scratch and re-do the theme of my site from scratch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So what has changed? The color scheme, the layouts, basically everything! One of the processes that I decided to implement this time was to utilize the Pattern Lab style of organization for my theme. I first tried to utilize the node version of Pattern Lab, but I found that there still seemed to be a few things that were still in flux with the codebase. I looked at other style guide generators until finally settling on &lt;a href=&#34;https://fbrctr.github.io/&#34;&gt;Fabricator&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-liked-about-fabricator&#34;&gt;What I liked about Fabricator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Setup&lt;/strong&gt; - Getting Fabricator setup within the theme structure of Hugo was as simple as running the command: &lt;code&gt;npm install fabricator --save&lt;/code&gt; in my theme directory. Fabricator already comes with a directory structure set up to quickly organize your assets, views, and materials (this is Fabricator&amp;rsquo;s method of organization). It made it so that I didn&amp;rsquo;t have to think through the architecture of the theme, it was simply handled for me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configuration&lt;/strong&gt; - The documentation that is provided on changing the default structure of Fabricator gave me exactly the direction I needed to implement my own custom version of Pattern Lab. I decided that I would stop at the template level of design as my pages are already being generated by Hugo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Template Language&lt;/strong&gt; - I found that the use of the HTML file extension just felt right at home with Hugo&amp;rsquo;s template language which is also uses the HTML file extension. The syntax that both use aren&amp;rsquo;t the same, but it was nice not to have to switch back and forth between handlebars and Hugo&amp;rsquo;s HTML templates.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Fabricators Theme&lt;/strong&gt; - I personally love the look and feel of Fabricator&amp;rsquo;s theme for viewing the toolkit styles and I like it just a little bit more than the minimal look and feel of PatternLab&amp;rsquo;s theme. When I got to show off my style guide, it feels more professional.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;what-i-don-t-like-about-fabricator&#34;&gt;What I don&amp;rsquo;t like about Fabricator&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Gulp&lt;/strong&gt; - Back when I was a consultant for NorthPoint Solutions, I was gung-ho to use Grunt, and then Gulp. After reading articles however on how to use NPM as a build tool, and even more recently on using webpack to compile assets, I feel like Gulp is a little heavy handed. Each time I run the Fabricator server (yeah it has it&amp;rsquo;s own server) it performs an &lt;code&gt;npm install&lt;/code&gt; and then runs its compilation task. My thought is to possibly switch to a webpack task on my next iteration of the theme.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging Tools&lt;/strong&gt; - While I don&amp;rsquo;t like PatternLab&amp;rsquo;s theme as much as I like Fabricator&amp;rsquo;s, PatternLab has this nifty tool to switch between small, medium, large, and lastly a &amp;lsquo;disco&amp;rsquo; mode that widens and narrows the viewport so as to see how responsive design is being handled. Now Chrome of course has it&amp;rsquo;s own responsive tool that I made use of, but the ability to quickly see how elements react react when widened and narrowed right from the header of the style guide is a nice feature to have. It would be pretty easy to implement it via Javascript so I might submit a PR with that feature to the Fabricator repository in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h3 id=&#34;prologue&#34;&gt;Prologue&lt;/h3&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am going to be writing up a tutorial on how I integrated Fabricator with Hugo in due time, but needless to say the set up was fairly straight forward. I was extremely impressed with the flexibility that Fabricator offered me. I was able to create, iterate, and update my style guide with ease. Some of the longer tasks with the new theme wasn&amp;rsquo;t the coding so much as the design and creation of icons and interactive form elements in Illustrator. If you want to take a look at the style guide of my site and see how it all comes together, feel free to check it out &lt;a href=&#34;https://mealeyst.github.io/macromealey/styleguide&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;All the best!&lt;/p&gt;
